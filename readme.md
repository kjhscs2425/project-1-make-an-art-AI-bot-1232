# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
# my drawing will look like a stack of 3D cubes stacked on top of eachother in a descending order

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
#The height and the length of each variable

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
# the repetion in my drawing is re-drawing the blocks over and over for six times 

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
# the main part in my drawing are the six blocks in the middle of the screen and the stars on top of the heighest block 

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
